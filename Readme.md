# Minimal Operating System Based on Xv6 (RISC-V Architecture)

## Special Thanks
* I would like to thank @Nix0712 for making a great Readme.md file for this project. I altered it a bit, but a lot of the original document is published by him. Check out his
[GitHub](https://github.com/Nix0712).

## Description

* Small time-sharing OS which provides multithreading and memory allocation based on the Risc-V architecture, emulated by QEMU emulator. This was a school project at the Faculty Of Electrical Engineering in Belgrade, Serbia for the year 2023/2024.

## Installation

### Arch Linux
### Install Dependencies and QEMU

1. Install the RISC-V toolchain and QEMU emulator:

   ```bash
   sudo pacman -U https://archive.archlinux.org/packages/r/riscv64-linux-gnu-gcc/riscv64-linux-gnu-gcc-8.3.0-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz
   sudo pacman -U https://archive.archlinux.org/packages/r/riscv64-linux-gnu-binutils/riscv64-linux-gnu-binutils-2.32-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz
   sudo pacman -S qemu-full qemu-base make
   ```

2. To prevent `pacman` from updating the RISC-V packages, add the following code to your `/etc/pacman.conf` file:

   ```bash
   IgnorePkg = riscv64-linux-gnu-gcc
   IgnorePkg = riscv64-linux-gnu-binutils
   ```

### Open in a Preconfigured Virtual Machine

Description: The virtual machine has been preconfigured and designed to ensure that all students can replicate the project setup without issues.

You can access the virtual machine using the link provided by the [university](https://www.etf.bg.ac.rs/):

**Note: The files provided are compatible with VMware 17.**

### Debugging Setup

For debugging, you need to install `riscv64-elf-gdb`:

```bash
sudo pacman -S riscv64-elf-gdb
```

## Usage 

### Starting the OS

To run the project with the default tests, simply use the following command:

```bash
make qemu
```

This will execute the predefined tests located in the `test` folder.

If you'd like to run custom tests, you can remove or modify the default test cases and create your own. Your custom test's main function should be named `userMain()`.

### How to Debug

To debug the project, follow these steps:

1. **Start QEMU in Debug Mode**  
   Run the following command to launch QEMU in debugging mode:

   ```bash
   make qemu-gdb
   ```

2. **Note the Debugging Port**  
   Once the build completes, you'll see a message similar to this:

   ```bash
   *** Now run 'gdb-multiarch' in another window with target remote args 'localhost:26000'.
   qemu-system-riscv64 -machine virt -bios none -kernel kernel -m 128M -smp 1 -nographic -S -gdb tcp::26000
   ```

   The important part is `localhost:[PORT_NUMBER]`. In this example, the port is `26000`, but it may vary in your case.


3. **Launch GDB**  
   In another terminal, start the GDB debugger by running:

   ```bash
   riscv64-elf-gdb
   ```

4. **Connect GDB to QEMU**  
   Connect GDB to QEMU using the port number noted earlier:

   ```bash
   target remote localhost:[PORT_NUMBER]
   ```

At this point, you can use GDB to debug the project. For more information on using GDB, refer to these resources:

- [GDB Step-by-Step Introduction](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gdb-step-by-step-introduction/)
- [Official GDB Documentation](https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/documentation/)

That's it! You're all set to debug your project.

**Note that you can clean the build**
```bash
make clean
```
